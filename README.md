# UFOs
Java Script

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We updated the HTLM and JS in order to add additional functionality to a site that was designed during the module. We updated the code to allow us to filter for UFO sightings based on 5 different criteria. 

## Analysis

- We are now able to filter the UFO sighting data by filtering  the results. 
- We can filter by following:
    - date
    - city
    - state
    - country 
    - shape

- The user can enter the above filter criteria in the image box below

## Summary

- The new design is quite nice and allows us to search by multiple different criteria. We should add a feature that allows us to clear the filter instantly without having to manualy change all the filter options.
