# UFOs
Java Script

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We updated the HTMN and JS in order to add additional functionality to a page that was designed during the module. We updated the code to allow us to filter for UFO sightings based on 5 different criteria. 

## Analysis

- We are now able to filter the UFP sighting data by filtering thrugh the results. 
- We can filter by following:
    - date
    - city
    - state
    - country 
    - shape

- The user can enter the above filter criteria

- We looked at the employees that we can grow to become the next generation of leaders and engineers to create a mentorship program for eligible employees. 
- Unfortuently, HP only has little over 1.5K eligible employees- there will be a rush of hiring in the upcoming future

The analysis was performed via SQL code

The code for the analysis can be located:

## Summary

- HP needs to fill over 90K roles
- HP needs to seriously focus on recruiting to add more mentoring ready employees
- In order to evaluate the shortages, we need to see what departments and roles the mentorship-eligible employees work in - we need to pull additional queries to evaluate the gaps
- HP will also need to take a look at the the overall employee base to see what fraction of overall employees are retiring soon, to really understand the impact.
